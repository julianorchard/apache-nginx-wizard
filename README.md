# Apache/Nginx Wizard

A simple but very handy Python 3 script to set up Apache and Nginx URL's with some sensible
configuration files. The steps and configurations in this file are ones I found
myself needing to do every time I configured a new URL, so I decided to write
a script to make it more straightforward. 

Only tested on Ubuntu 20.04, LTS, but should work on other distributions. 

## Useage

Simply clone the repo, and run the script with root priviledges: 

```
$ ~ git clone https://github.com/julianorchard/apache-nginx-wizard
$ ~ sudo ./apache-nginx-wizard
```

## Support

Please [get in touch](mailto:hello@julianorchard.co.uk) with me if you want
help with this script, or submit an issue.
